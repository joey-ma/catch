  "description": "Snake is one of the first video game genres. Catch, a browser based version of the classic snake game, is created using an understanding of OOP and DOM manipulation to create this dynamic, single-page app. Catch is a tribute to both the classic snake game as well as the Pokemon franchise. (I still remember playing the 1st generation (monochrome) and 2nd generation (color) Game Boys! Anyways...) Hope you'll enjoy!",
